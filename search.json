    "text": "Stereo vision plays a key role in size and distance perception. It’s thought to be an effect of “vergence” (eye rotation), since the closer the object, the more the eyes have to rotate to fixate on it. However, in Linton (2020) and Linton (2021), I show that vergence provides no useful size or distance information.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, I argue for an account grounded in a purely cognitive association between accentuated stereo 3D shape (from horizontal disparities) and closer distances given horizontal disparities fall off with distance squared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINTON SCALE ILLUSION\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test this, I combine the horizontal disparities associated with normal viewing with the vergence and vertical disparities associated with near viewing.\n\n\n\n\nAnd the illusion alternates between this condition and near viewing. And what we find is that this new condition looks “Normal” not “Small”, indicating that what is driving the miniaturisation effect in near viewing really are horizontal disparities (the only difference between the two conditions).\n\n\n\n\nSwitching between the two conditions we see a startling effect: the “scale” of the scene changes, even though all that has changed is the geometry of the scene, not the apparent distance of the scene itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n      \n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR DEMO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINK TO DEMO - suitable for PC VR and Oculus Quest 3 with PC Link.\n\n\nOriginally presented at the Vision Sciences Society (VSS)(2025) Demo Night and European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP)(2025) Demo Night, this VR demo alternates between the two conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFURTHER READING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Linton, P.
